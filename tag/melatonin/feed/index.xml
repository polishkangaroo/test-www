										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A piece I wrote&nbsp;for the British Council Blog&nbsp;prior to FameLab International. </em>|<em><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How do our bodies know when it’s night?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our eyes, there are photoreceptors: cells which can determine the difference between light and darkness. But how do the&nbsp;kidneys, liver or stomach know when it’s dark or light?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During periods of darkness, the photoreceptors in our eyes send a signal to a part of our brain called the pineal gland, which starts the production of melatonin. Melatonin is known as the ‘hormone of the night’. It’s a chemical expression of darkness. It acts as an endocrine hormone, meaning that it’s released into the blood. While circulating in our body, it chemically informs all our organs that it’s dark outside and all body parts should be getting ready to sleep.<span id="more-688"></span>Because melatonin’s activity is a natural way of regulating the ‘body clock’, in some countries this hormone is sold as a supplement for people with insomnia to help their bodies go to sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This same hormone is produced in a range of species: animals, plants, and even microbes. In other mammals, melatonin can play a variety of physiological roles. For instance, initial studies on melatonin using hamsters showed that increased consumption of the hormone shrinks hamsters’ testicles. While this may sound menacing to human males, is it necessarily a cause for concern?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Does melatonin really shrink testicles?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let us first look at the reasons for these findings. Feeding hamsters increasing amounts of melatonin is a signal for their bodies that periods of darkness (i.e., nights) are getting longer and longer. In nature, progressively longer nights (and therefore shortening days) are a sign of approaching winter. During winter, hamsters, like many other animals, undergo what is called a daily torpor –&nbsp;a period of lowered metabolism and decreased body temperature. This metabolic shut-down happens because in winter, food is scarce, and in order to survive, animals need to focus solely on survival. They will therefore not invest energy in any non-essential body parts, such as testicles. After all, winter is not the best time to think about reproduction or impress the lady hamsters with big gonads! So melatonin does indeed cause hamsters’ testicles to shrink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But does melatonin work in the same way with humans? Are men who pop melatonin pills likely to experience shrinking testes? The short answer is ‘no’. Humans and hamsters are very different species. Unlike hamsters, we are not seasonal breeders; our physiology is not governed by light to the same extent as theirs. We don’t go into torpor in winter. Men’s testicles remain the same size throughout the year and so do not naturally shrink when days become shorter. In short, melatonin consumption is not going to have an effect on human testes. The lesson here is that we need to be very cautious when interpreting the results of research on animals, as they are not always applicable to humans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why is researching melatonin useful?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from assessing the direct benefits of melatonin for humans –&nbsp;melatonin as a sleeping pill, melatonin as an antioxidant, and so on –&nbsp;there are other reasons for studying this chemical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because I am a conservation biologist, I find research on animal reproduction fascinating and potentially vital for the captive breeding of endangered species. Our knowledge of how melatonin affects the reproductive cycles plays an important role in the development of assisted reproductive techniques widely used in conservation. Even little things such as lights left on at night in zoo enclosures might have an effect on the reproductive physiology of some animals, by affecting their melatonin levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is simply amazing how such a tiny compound can be so universal, and so powerful.</p>

<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">An academic at Nottingham Trent University has made the international rounds of a science communication competition – which challenges researchers to present a topic to a non-specialist audience in just three minutes.<span id="more-655"></span></p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">Dr Joanna Bagniewska, a lecturer in wildlife conservation in the University&#8217;s School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences, will compete against more than 25 other contestants after winning the national final of &#8216;FameLab&#8217; in her native Poland.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">Her topic was &#8216;The curious incident of testicles at night time&#8217;, examining the influence of the melatonin hormone on the physiology of humans and other animals.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">FameLab aims to &#8216;find the new voice of science and engineering across the world&#8217;.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">Contestants have just three minutes to present a topic in science, engineering or maths in an engaging way – without PowerPoint and with limited props &#8211; and judges are looking for those who shine in content, clarity and charisma.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">Joanna, who will be representing Poland in the international round, said: &#8220;I am very pleased with the result, particularly because I usually do not use Polish to &#8216;talk science&#8217;.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a challenge and a wonderful adventure, and I am looking forward to representing my country and Nottingham Trent University in the international rounds.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">The international rounds will take place on 5 June at The Times Cheltenham Science Festival.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dr Joanna Bagniewska, a zoologist from Nottingham Trent University, will represent Poland during the international final of FameLab, a competition for young researchers.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-598"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How to share the results of research that has taken months or even years to get done if you have only three minutes’ time? That’s no easy task, and one that many luminaries of science keep stumbling over, too. FameLab has raised delivering such ultrashort speeches to the level of art. The competition rewards the most charismatic young researchers who manage to thrill the audience while explaining their mission within 180 seconds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Staged for the first time in the UK in 2005, FameLab has now its national editions in over twenty countries across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. This year’s was the third edition to be organized in Poland. Out of the seventy entrants who took part in the competition, three were named as the laureates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are used to presenting our research results to scientists during specialist conferences. But here we can try and learn to talk to laypeople, which for me is a very valuable experience,” Dr Joanna Bagniewska, the winner of the Polish edition of FameLab, told Poland.gov.pl. In early June she will travel to Cheltenham in the UK to represent Poland during the international final of the contest. “People should be able to understand what we do, working as we do for public money,” added Dr Bagniewska.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img title="FameLab1, Kalendarium 2014" src="https://foto.poland.gov.pl/gallery/Kalendarium_2014/FameLab1.jpg" alt="FameLab1, Kalendarium 2014" width="450" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna Bagniewska, photo Wojciech Surdziel</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A University of Oxford graduate, Dr Bagniewska teaches ecology and biodiversity at Nottingham Trent University. One of her areas of interest is biotelemetry, or the observation of animals in their natural habitats; she has also examined bees’ ability to detect drugs. Entitled “A dark predicament. What dangers to men lurk at night?”, her presentation dealt with research showing that the large amount of melatonin, or sleep hormone, being produced at night make males’ testicles shrink. Although the research was done on hamsters, news of the potential threat to men soon travelled around the world. This went to show that results of tests on animals should be analysed with caution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second prize went to Justyna Lesiak, a PhD student from Munich University. She talked about Clostridium, a genus of bacteria she has researched which could soon provide a cure for tumours that are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Moreover, Justyna Lesiak was presented with special awards of the Minister of Science and Higher Education, and BASF Poland, as well as the audience award funded by the British Council, which co-organized the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The third laureate, Tomasz Jakubek, is a chemist from the Jagiellonian University. His presentation discussed catalysts that lower combustion temperature, and thus eliminate harmful soot which is a by-product of coal burning. Tomasz Jakubek was also awarded two special prizes by BMW Group Poland and BASF.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This year’s edition of FameLab was dominated by biologists, chemists, and biotechnologists, whereas last year it was engineers, physicists and mathematicians who called the shots. We are happy to see more and more people with advanced scientific degrees send in their applications,” Paulina Butlewska of the Copernicus Science Centre’s Communication and Promotion Division, which co-organized FameLab, told Poland.gov.pl. She added that each edition was at a higher level than the previous one, with scientists being more adept at preparing themselves for the competition.</p>
