<aside class="grid-two content-share"><strong>A dangerous fungus has been sweeping across North America with devastating consequences. In the past decade, between 5m and 7m bats in the US and Canada have been wiped out as a result of the fungal disease known as white nose syndrome, which alters their behaviour in potentially deadly ways. But the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02441-z">latest research</a>&nbsp;shows there might be hope for researchers trying to battle the disease, following the discovery that UV light appears to destroy the fungus’s DNA.</strong></aside>
<aside></aside>
</div>
<div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body">
<p>White nose syndrome is caused by the fungus&nbsp;<em>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</em>, which grows on the bats’ muzzles (hence the name) and other hairless body parts including wings, and&nbsp;<a href="https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-8-135">causes skin lesions</a>.&nbsp;<em>P. destructans</em>&nbsp;is psychrophilic, meaning it thrives in cold temperatures between 4℃ and 20℃. This means it affects bats during hibernation.</p>
<p><span id="more-1781"></span></p>
<p>The itchy, painful lesions cause infected bats to repeatedly wake from hibernation, leaving them confused and causing them to display&nbsp;<a href="https://www.batcon.org/our-work/regions/contact-bci/usa-canada/white-nose-syndrome">highly unusual behavior</a>, such as flying outside during daylight in nearly freezing temperatures. The cold, lack of food and abnormal activity leads to bats depleting their winter fat reserves, and starving, dehydrating or freezing to death. As a result, the disease can kill between&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100113/full/463144a.html">90% and 100%</a>&nbsp;of bats in affected hibernating colonies.</p>
<p>Out of the 47 bat species native to the US and Canada, over half rely on hibernation for survival.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/about/bats-affected-wns">Nine of these species</a>&nbsp;(including two endangered and one threatened) already show symptoms of white nose syndrome.&nbsp;<em>P. destructans</em>&nbsp;has also been found in another six species (including one endangered) that don’t yet show symptoms. The little brown bat (<em>Myotis lucifugus</em>), once the most common bat in North America, is now predicted to face&nbsp;<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5992/679">regional extinction</a>.</p>
<p>Bats normally live a long time and produce only a single pup each year, so affected species are unlikely to recover quickly. Not only is this bad for biodiversity, but it could also have a serious economic impact on humans. In temperate regions, bats eat up to 600 insects a night and so provide a vital pest-control service for North American farmers, effectively worth&nbsp;<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/41">US$3.7 billion a year</a>.</p>
<h5>How did this bat-astrophe come about?</h5>
<p><em>P. destructans</em>&nbsp;has probably co-existed with bats in Eurasia for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02441-z">millions of years</a>. As a result, these bats have evolved defences against the fungus. So in this part of the world, despite the occasional mild outbreak of white nose syndrome, the disease&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(11)00192-3">doesn’t significantly impact entire groups of bats</a>. But when&nbsp;<em>P. destructans</em>&nbsp;was introduced to the previously unexposed American bats, the effects were disastrous.</p>
<p>White nose syndrome was discovered in North America&nbsp;<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5911/227">in 2006</a>. We know that the fungus was most likely spread by human activity because the North American fungus is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215000792">almost genetically identical</a>&nbsp;to some of the samples found in Europe. Also, bats don’t migrate between the two continents and some of the distances between contaminated caves in the US are longer than the flying range of affected bats. On top of that, the first reports of white nose syndrome came from a&nbsp;<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/16/8/10-0002_article">popular tourist cave near Albany, New York</a>. So the fungus probably spread via contaminated clothing and caving equipment from tourists visiting affected areas.</p>
<p>Since then, white nose syndrome has become one of the most severe wildlife diseases ever recorded. Yet there may literally be a light at the end of the tunnel. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02441-z">research team from the US Forest Service</a>&nbsp;has discovered that&nbsp;<em>P. destructans</em>&nbsp;is extremely sensitive to ultra-violet light, particularly to UV-C light that kills germs but doesn’t cause skin cancer. They found that moderate doses of UV-C light killed over 99% of the fungus, and that even low doses killed 85%.</p>
<p>The effect is so potent because UV light destroys the fungus’s DNA, and, unlike&nbsp;<a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-6">related fungi</a>,&nbsp;<em>P. destructans</em>&nbsp;can’t repair the damage. Further tests are on the way to check whether UV light causes any damage to the bats themselves. But the fact that UV-C light has already been used in treatments of&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08549.x/abstract;jsessionid=DACFFB496B5103A02CDAC89BD89CB96F.f01t02">other fungal infections</a>&nbsp;in mammals means the discovery is very promising.</p>
<p>Managing wildlife diseases can be difficult and expensive. Think of how hard it would be to apply fungicide skin cream to tens of thousands of bats hanging from the top of a cave. But shining a simple hand-held UV-C light source on them would be much easier. So this research could have huge implications for protecting North American bats.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>A piece I wrote&nbsp;for the British Council Blog&nbsp;prior to FameLab International. </em>|<em><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How do our bodies know when it’s night?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our eyes, there are photoreceptors: cells which can determine the difference between light and darkness. But how do the&nbsp;kidneys, liver or stomach know when it’s dark or light?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During periods of darkness, the photoreceptors in our eyes send a signal to a part of our brain called the pineal gland, which starts the production of melatonin. Melatonin is known as the ‘hormone of the night’. It’s a chemical expression of darkness. It acts as an endocrine hormone, meaning that it’s released into the blood. While circulating in our body, it chemically informs all our organs that it’s dark outside and all body parts should be getting ready to sleep.<span id="more-688"></span>Because melatonin’s activity is a natural way of regulating the ‘body clock’, in some countries this hormone is sold as a supplement for people with insomnia to help their bodies go to sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This same hormone is produced in a range of species: animals, plants, and even microbes. In other mammals, melatonin can play a variety of physiological roles. For instance, initial studies on melatonin using hamsters showed that increased consumption of the hormone shrinks hamsters’ testicles. While this may sound menacing to human males, is it necessarily a cause for concern?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Does melatonin really shrink testicles?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let us first look at the reasons for these findings. Feeding hamsters increasing amounts of melatonin is a signal for their bodies that periods of darkness (i.e., nights) are getting longer and longer. In nature, progressively longer nights (and therefore shortening days) are a sign of approaching winter. During winter, hamsters, like many other animals, undergo what is called a daily torpor –&nbsp;a period of lowered metabolism and decreased body temperature. This metabolic shut-down happens because in winter, food is scarce, and in order to survive, animals need to focus solely on survival. They will therefore not invest energy in any non-essential body parts, such as testicles. After all, winter is not the best time to think about reproduction or impress the lady hamsters with big gonads! So melatonin does indeed cause hamsters’ testicles to shrink.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But does melatonin work in the same way with humans? Are men who pop melatonin pills likely to experience shrinking testes? The short answer is ‘no’. Humans and hamsters are very different species. Unlike hamsters, we are not seasonal breeders; our physiology is not governed by light to the same extent as theirs. We don’t go into torpor in winter. Men’s testicles remain the same size throughout the year and so do not naturally shrink when days become shorter. In short, melatonin consumption is not going to have an effect on human testes. The lesson here is that we need to be very cautious when interpreting the results of research on animals, as they are not always applicable to humans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why is researching melatonin useful?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from assessing the direct benefits of melatonin for humans –&nbsp;melatonin as a sleeping pill, melatonin as an antioxidant, and so on –&nbsp;there are other reasons for studying this chemical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because I am a conservation biologist, I find research on animal reproduction fascinating and potentially vital for the captive breeding of endangered species. Our knowledge of how melatonin affects the reproductive cycles plays an important role in the development of assisted reproductive techniques widely used in conservation. Even little things such as lights left on at night in zoo enclosures might have an effect on the reproductive physiology of some animals, by affecting their melatonin levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is simply amazing how such a tiny compound can be so universal, and so powerful.</p>
