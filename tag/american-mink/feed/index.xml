<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jacobs.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-309" src="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jacobs.png?w=500" alt="Jacobs" width="500" height="306" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Can animals change the way we think? Can we learn anything from invasive species? How do we measure animal behavior in the wild? Jacobs alumna Dr. Joanna Bagniewska (Class of 2006) ventured to answer these questions at the recent TEDxWarsaw in March.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna’s talk entitled <strong>“Learning the ways of the animals” </strong>was given at the independently organized TED event in Warsaw on March 21. She spoke about invasive species: plants and animals brought outside of their native range that have had huge environmental, agricultural, and financial impacts on their new surroundings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-306"></span>Although the war against biological invasives is costly (in Europe estimated at €12 billion per year), Joanna pointed out a silver lining. Like any powerful enemy, the adaptable and resilient invasive species challenge us to change our thinking; they push us to develop new methods of “espionage”. She said: “To match our invaders’ versatility, we need to come up with novel technologies and new analytical techniques for measuring their behavior in the wild.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna’s work on the invasive American mink in Europe helped her develop methodologies (based on miniaturized logging devices) that can be applied to a diversity of semi-aquatic animals. Such methods are not only crucial for learning more about minks themselves. They are important because animals dependent on or adapted to living in water can be found across most groups of mammals – and while some are invasive and may cause a serious threat to biodiversity, others are endangered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, before any eradication or conservation action is undertaken, there is a pressing need to find out as much as possible about the behavior and ecology of a particular species, she told the audience. In turn methods developed for an invasive could also be applied in order to save an endangered animal. Despite invasives often posing a danger to local species they can definitely contribute a lot to our knowledge and understanding of different branches of science.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna graduated from Jacobs University with a <a href="https://www.jacobs-university.de/undergraduate-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BSc in Biology</a>; she later finished her MSc and DPhil at <a href="https://www.wildcru.org/">Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit</a>. Her doctoral thesis focused on using novel biotelemetric methods to investigate the behavioral patterns of free-living semi-aquatic animals. Her research interests include wildlife conservation, behavioral ecology, and the use of technological solutions in biology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design)</strong> is a global set of conferences formed to disseminate &#8220;ideas worth spreading.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">WildCRU&#8217;s DPhil student, Joanna Bagniewska, was awarded the Acorn Ecology Best Student Presentation Prize at the recent Mammal Society Conference. There were a number of great talks at the event but Joanna&#8217;s presentation on the diving patterns of semi-aquatic, shallow-diving, small-bodied mammals was unanimously chosen as the winner.  The head of the voting committee, Sue Searle from Acorn Ecology, said that Joanna&#8217;s presentation was not only informative and engaging, but also had the extra &#8220;spark&#8221; that the jury was looking for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna was presenting WildCRU&#8217;s research on American mink using miniaturised Time-Depth Recorders (TDRs), tiny devices which measure temperature and pressure over time.  Using TDRs allows a precise determination of the diving behaviour of mink, as well as the examination of their activity patterns.  The methods explored by Joanna and her colleagues can also be used in measuring the activity of other semi-aquatic mammals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Article from <a href="https://cryptozoologynews.blogspot.co.uk/2009_07_26_archive.html">Cryptozoology Online</a></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> <a href="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/cz.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-319" src="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/cz.png?w=500" alt="cz" width="500" height="349" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wildwood is hosting researchers from Oxford to test equipment to learn more about mink in the wild.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team from Oxford University WildCRU (Wildlife Conservation Research Unit), have put a collar on the mink which will record depth and temperature. This will allow future researchers to use the equipment on wild mink to learn more about their movements especially how they dive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is hoped that the research will help to see what mink are doing in the wild, by seeing the pattern of activity of the mink over long periods of time. The new data logger is the latest and smallest of its type, and is being tested in a controlled situation at the park.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The data logger is very clever it measures the temperature and depth of water in which the mink is swimming&#8221; commented Joanna Bagniewska, WildCRU researcher &#8220;The whole unit is no bigger than a boiled sweet and the collar is very similar to ones used on cats.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-318"></span>This is very important as the mink is one of the major causes of the fall in water vole populations since it escaped in to the British countryside so learning more about how they actually behave in the wild will enable scientists to be able to protect British species like the water vole in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mink are just one of the huge range of British animals that can be seen at the Wildwood Discovery Park, for more information visit the website at www.wildwoodtrust.org or telephone 0871 7820087.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wildwood is an ideal day out for all the family where you can come &#8216;nose to nose&#8217; with British Wildlife. Wildwood offers its members and visitors a truly inspirational way to learn about the natural history of Britain by actually seeing the wildlife that once lived here, like the wolf, beaver, red squirrel, wild boar and many more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wildwood is situated close to Canterbury, just off the A291 between Herne Bay and Canterbury. For more information visit our website at www.wildwoodtrust.org or telephone 0871 782008.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>American Mink &#8211; <em>Neovison</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mink is a medium-sized member of the weasel family. The first American mink were brought to British fur farms in 1929 and all wild mink in Britain today are descendants of escapees. The natural wild colouring is a glossy dark brown, appearing almost black in some light. Commercial farming selectively bred much paler colours, hence most of those in the wild in Britain are a lighter brown. Mink spend up to 80% of their time in their dens, sleeping, grooming and eating food they have carried home. Frequently found near water, they are often mistaken for otters, although mink are in fact considerably smaller.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mink are a major factor in the decimation of the water vole population, because they are small enough to follow their prey down its burrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Size</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Male: length of head/body 42 cm plus tail18 cm.<br />
Female: length of head/body 36 cm plus tail 15 cm</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elongated body, relatively short legs, limited webbing between the toes, glossy dark brown coat, commonly white fur patches on chin, throat, chest and groin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Habitat</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May be seen on every kind of waterway, streams, rivers, and canals,but are capable of living away from water provided prey, such as rabbits, small mammals and birds, is available.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Young</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Delayed implantation delays the 30 day gestation period to 39 &#8211; 42 days. Kits are born in a den lined with vegetation in April &#8211; May. One litter, 4 &#8211; 6 young. At 10 weeks they cease to depend on their mother for food. They learn to hunt with their mother. In August they disperse in search of their own territories. Females settle within 5 km of their place of birth, males 10 km May have 2 &#8211; 10 dens close to their favourite hunting grounds, usually made in the eroded roots of oaks, sycamores or willows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Diet</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rabbits, ducks, water voles, shrews, fish, frogs, crayfish, eels, moorhens, rats, birds and eggs are all taken by the mink.</p>
