										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>My essay for the British Council&#8217;s collection&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.britishcouncil.pl/sites/default/files/crossing_points_uk_-_poland._common_interests_shared_concerns_0.pdf"><em>&#8220;Crossing Points: UK-Poland Common interests, shared concerns&#8221;</em></a> |</strong></p>
<p>When I first came to the UK, in 2006, two years after Polish accession to the EU and the opening of the British labour market to Poles, there was a popular joke going round.</p>
<p>A British hotel manager puts out an advert for a cleaner. A man responds. The hotel manager asks where he is from. The man answers – Poland. The hotel manager then says: Aaah, Poland! So – what did you do your PhD in?</p>
<p>The joke is bittersweet in its capture of the phenomenon of the huge post-2004 economic migration. The difference in wages between Poland and the UK was so striking that we heard stories of Polish medical doctors working as cleaners in the UK during the week – for financial reasons – and only flying to Poland for the weekends to practice medicine. One newspaper published a photograph of Polish squatters sleeping in sleeping bags on the ground at Victoria Station, with the caption: “From the left, we see an engineer, a medical doctor, an architect and a lawyer”. Regardless of their experience and education, Poles were happy to cling onto the most menial jobs in the UK, to allow them to make ends meet.</p>
<p>But within a few years the profile of the migrants started to change. First of all, improving their English skills, developing stronger support networks and finding out more about life in the UK and British hiring culture allowed the current migrants to start climbing up the economic ladder. Secondly, a number of Poles (amongst them academics) deliberately moved to the UK to work in line with their qualifications. Thirdly, being part of the EU meant qualifying for domestic rather than international university fees, which lead to a drastic increase in the numbers of Polish university students in the UK. In this essay, I would like to take a closer look at the case of international movement in academia, particularly in science – with a special focus on Poland and the UK.</p>
<p>I arrived in the UK as an example of that third instance – a freshly minted Bachelor of Science, ready to start an MSc at Oxford University’s Zoology Department. At that time I was one of just 81 Polish students at the University of Oxford. A few years earlier, before Polish accession to the EU, the number of Poles enrolled at Oxford was rather constant, oscillating around 20. Since then, there has been a steady increase:&nbsp; in 2009, the number of Polish students at the University exceeded 150, in 2014 – 200, and in 2017 – 250 (based on Oxford University Student Statistics, <a href="https://www1.admin.ox.ac.uk/aad/studentregistry/sdma/statistics/student/">https://www1.admin.ox.ac.uk/aad/studentregistry/sdma/statistics/student/</a>). I am very proud to see the growing numbers of Oxford Poles, achieved not only because of the high quality of applicants, but also thanks to numerous mentoring programmes (e.g. Project Access, The Kings Foundation) where current students and alumni assist candidates with their application process.</p>
<p>Such a continuous increase is not reflected in overall numbers of Polish students in the UK. True, after Poland joined the EU, the figure more than doubled (from 965 Poles studying throughout the UK in 2003 to 2185 in 2004), and continued to grow until peaking in 2008 at 9145. But then, presumably due to the global financial crisis followed by the tripling of student fees, the number of Poles at British institutions plummeted, reaching a trough of around 5200 between 2012 and 2014. Since then, the numbers started to slowly rise, and have reached 6585 in 2016 – which could be interpreted as a move to “get in” before the onset of Brexit.</p>
<p>In just a few years, we have witnessed a shift from the purely economic migration, to a “brain drain”, or human capital flight, of Poles who entered the UK not only for the income, but because of the numerous opportunities it offered. And in academic terms, Britain certainly has a lot to offer, with 28 of its universities ranking in the top 200 in the world.</p>
<p>Currently, Poles at British academic institutions are not only more numerous – they are also better organized and more united than they used to be. Polish students formed the Federation of Polish Student Societies in the UK, which represents their interests in a unified front. In 2008, there was one annual student conference – the Congress of Polish Societies; currently there are at least five events, ranging in topics from the sciences (Science: Polish Perspectives), through business and economics (LSE Polish Economic Forum) to innovation and new technologies (Poland 2.0). The choices of the subject matter are not accidental – I have observed (though this is anecdotal evidence rather than anything I can back by hard data) a stronger profiling of students post-2010, with many in the sciences, engineering and business, and fewer in the humanities. This is logical – if you have to take out a huge student loan, will you be able to repay it after a theology degree? (This remark is not meant as a dig at theologians – after all, the author of this essay is a zoologist, hardly a money-making career!).</p>
<p>Surprisingly enough, the tripled university fees have not prompted British students to seek academic experiences abroad, in countries where tuition is either free, or very cheap (and the living costs much more affordable than in Britain). I am not even suggesting a move to the Wild, Wild East – the permafrost-covered land of vodka-drinking polar bears that Poland still is in the eyes of many a Brit – but what about a much more civilized country, such as Germany, Sweden or Denmark, where not only is tuition free for foreigners, but there are numerous programs run entirely in English?</p>
<p>Until now, Britain has been in a very fortunate position of being able to attract high quality students and academics from around the world. The benefits were great not just for the individuals (British or international), but also for British science as a whole. British academics – and in this context I refer to ones doing research in Britain rather than holding a UK passport! – are incredibly successful at obtaining European grants: for every pound Britain spends on science in the EU, British scientists get two back in grant money. Attracting high quality academics is what made British science stand out. The current plans to make it more difficult for international students to stay in the UK after graduation is shooting oneself in the foot – after all, it is the highly skilled, well-integrated migrants that will really boost the country’s economy.</p>
<p>Research, particularly in the sciences, is by nature, collaborative. International teams have a broader range of perspectives, experiences and ideas. International co-authored papers have a substantially higher impact than domestic only papers. They get read more, and they have more influence on the scientific community and beyond. Yet Brexit is likely to make international collaborations more difficult. With increasing barriers to free movement, and uncertainty regarding science funding, British researchers may choose to move out, leaving Britain to face its own brain drain, particularly when countries such as Germany and France are emerging as scientific or engineering heavyweights. Brits will certainly need to make more of a conscious effort if they would like to continue to cooperate with research groups in Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>Polish scientists working abroad could perhaps set a useful example in this respect. One worthwhile initiative which appeared recently in the UK is the Science: Polish Perspectives conference and movement. The project started in 2012 as a cooperation between Oxford University Polish Society and its equivalent from The Other Place, with the idea of bringing together scientists of Polish descent working outside of Poland.&nbsp; Science: Polish Perspectives is an annual conference, alternating between Oxford and Cambridge, showcasing research from scientific areas as diverse as astronomy and biochemistry, or quantum computing and ecology. The presentations follow a TED-talk format, and have to not only be of very high scientific quality, but also be comprehensible for a non-specialist (although scientific) audience. Initially, the aims of the conference were threefold: to unite Polish scientific diaspora, to showcase ground-breaking research, and to improve the image of Poles in the UK. However soon it became apparent that the platform can lead to interdisciplinary, international collaborations; it was also a great opportunity for Polish institutions to demonstrate opportunities they offer to academics hoping to return to their homeland.</p>
<p>Six years down the line, Science: Polish Perspectives, and its sister organisation, the Polonium Foundation, organise regional meet-ups in Germany, Italy, Belgium and Sweden. They run research projects investigating the needs and aspirations of Polish academics abroad. They form a bridge between Poland and its scientific diaspora.</p>
<p>While Polish scientists are scattered throughout Europe and beyond, Poland is trying to make the most of them. On one hand, they act as cultural and scientific ambassadors, on the other, they often provide the country with external expertise. At the same time, over the span of just a few years Poland has been able to offer good opportunities for returnees, with increasing availability of high quality grants targeting &nbsp;both Poles moving back to their homeland, and foreigners interested in working in Poland.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even as the financial conditions are becoming more attractive, Poland still has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to the social aspects of immigration. Being a foreigner in Poland is still not easy – logistically, culturally, linguistically – and this may be a big push factor for both foreigners and a lot of Poles with foreign life partners. Bringing about this type of change takes time – however this is an area in which Poland could take a leaf from Britain’s book. Very much like the fact that, say, making the working conditions in academia more women-friendly results in policies that benefit all employees, making a country more foreigner-friendly will make it more user-friendly for nationals as well. I believe that Poland could use a bit more transparency in everyday life – starting from revealing proposed salary bands on job adverts, through making administrative processes more straight-forward, down to perhaps providing clearer signage in the labyrinthine structures of Warsaw underpasses. While Poland has been very good (in fact, much better than the UK) at making provisions for young parents – for instance through its scheme of parental leaves – Polish kindergartens and schools are not yet ready to embrace diversity, from both the organisational and cultural perspectives. Finally, Poland certainly could take a leaf from Britain’s book when it comes to online presence – be it in the capacity of national branding (such as the “Britain is Great” campaign), strategies for a successful national presence in social media, or building awareness of the opportunities that it offers. Currently Poland relies too heavily on personal connections when it comes to advertising job posts – outsiders without a robust support network are starting at a significant disadvantage, no matter how willing they are to find work.</p>
<p>In summary, Britain can learn from Poland how to create and maintain – and make the most of! – a strong academic diaspora, while Poland can learn how to create a society attractive for foreigners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>My article for the <a href="https://www.eaie.org/our-resources/library/publication/Forum-Magazine/2018-spring-forum.html">EAIE Forum &#8211; Our Gendered World</a></em> |</p>
<p>The metaphor of a glass ceiling, an invisible, often unacknowledged barrier that keeps a certain demographic from career advancement, is often used in the context of women in science. The phenomenon is so globally widespread that it has given rise to the concept of a “Glass Ceiling Index”, an indicator used to quantify gender equity in science. The GCI is one of many measures employed by the European Commission in the SHE Figures document, outlining the current state of gender equality in research and innovation throughout the European Union.</p>
<p>The presence of women is, unsurprisingly, the lowest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields, as these disciplines have traditionally attracted more male than female scholars on all academic levels. However, even in STEM subjects with a high intake of female undergraduates, such as biological sciences, there is a disproportionate lack of female progression onto next stages of academic career, despite high academic achievements of women at all levels. Thus, while the number of women is high at an undergraduate stage, the proportion decreases at each progression point – postgraduate, postdoctoral, lecturer – leaving very few females at the professorial level. This progressive drop-out is known as “the leaking pipeline”, and is both global and trans-disciplinary.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond undergrad</strong></p>
<p>Currently in many countries females comprise around 50% of undergraduate students; in Europe, the representation of women at this stage is often higher than of men – e.g. in Sweden it reaches 65%. Yet, according to the SHE Figures report, at the professorial level the proportion of women is very low, for the most part below 15%. Once again, the figures are most drastic in the STEM subjects, as while European humanities and social sciences find themselves with 30% and 23.5% of female full-time professors, these numbers stand at only 9.8% in engineering and technology, and 15.8% in the natural sciences.</p>
<p>What is more, there is a pronounced gender pay gap in academia. According to statistics from the UK collated by the University and College Union, in 2015-16, women on academic contracts earned, on average, 12% less than their male counterparts. In the US and Canada that figure was just under 14% for full professors (based on data from the U.S. Education Department and Canadian Association for University Teachers).</p>
<p>Many explanations have been put forward to account for the glass ceiling phenomenon and the resultant major underrepresentation of qualified women in leadership roles – institutional biases, implicit and direct discrimination (including outright sexism), exclusion from the Old Boys’ Club, lack of role models, difficult work-life choices, or lack of confidence in the women themselves. The contributing factors are so numerous and diverse, that two researchers, Kris De Welde and Sandra L. Laursen, suggested an alternative name for the difficulties women face in academia: the “glass obstacle course”.</p>
<p><strong>The glass fence</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, another “glass” problem arises – the “glass fences” keeping women out of collaborative, international projects. International collaborations are a fundamental part of research, particularly in STEM fields. Multi-national projects bring together varied expertise, background, facilities and perspectives. Publications co-authored by international teams have a substantially higher impact than domestic-only papers: they get a wider readership, are cited more often, and have more influence on the scientific community, policy makers and other stakeholders. In order to maximise their scientific output and impact, today’s researchers attempt to be as mobile as possible, often internationally. However, while in other areas, such as business, international mobility carries with it bonuses such as paying school fees for the children, or assisting with finding a job for the spouse, academia still assumes that the researcher is single, unattached, with no caring responsibilities. According to Katherine Zippel, associate professor of sociology at Northeastern University, women are triply disadvantaged when it comes to international mobility – they tend to have less access to international opportunities as they are less likely to obtain positions at better funded institutions; they are in non-tenured, less secure job positions then men, which hampers the creation of a stable international network, and finally, they are the ones who most often bear the brunt of family-related responsibilities.</p>
<p>As a result, women are less likely to participate in international collaborations (23.5% compared to 33% of men, in a study of doctoral recipients in academic positions in America). What is more, they are less likely to co-author publications with international colleagues, despite the overall growing trend in cross-national collaborations (as stated by Elsevier’s Gender in the Global Research Landscape report).  In STEM fields, this contributes to the ongoing underrepresentation of women.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking the glass</strong></p>
<p>One way of addressing gender inequality in British institutions is the Athena SWAN (Scientific Women’s Academic Network) charter, founded in 2005. It recognises and celebrates examples of good practice towards the advancement of gender equality in higher education and research. Some of the recognised actions include outreach and mentoring programmes, reducing bias in recruitment, devising flexible and part-time working schemes which ensure career progression, or providing better access to childcare. Initially, the programme was limited to STEM subjects; currently it has expanded to include other disciplines.</p>
<p>Similarly, mobility schemes such as the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship allow women to actively pursue an international career in science. Currently in dual-career households it is often the higher-earning partner who dictates the mobility strategy – therefore providing financial independence and promoting equal pay leads female scientists towards a much more international professional life.</p>
<p>Research by Mary Bonawitz and Nicole Andel shows that in 2009 the average age of American college professors was 59, and their gender male. Most of these professors will be retiring by the age of 70, creating a gap that may be filled by a new wave of an equally accomplished, if more diverse, professorial body. Creating a working environment which takes into account the needs of parents, carers, researchers with special needs, will be beneficial for the new academic generation.</p>

<article id="contentArea" class=" ">
<div class="articleBody">
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;m worried that after my current contract finishes, one of the prerequisites could be a permanent residence card,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to apply for EU grant money, but how much longer will it be available for?&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-1661"></span></p>
<div class="ad-placeholder" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Britain&#8217;s top universities have long been among the world&#8217;s most sought-after destinations for study and research, drawing the brightest minds from all corners of the globe. But since Britons voted in June to leave the 28-nation EU, many in the science community say the U.K. risks losing the money, the international influence — and crucially, the talent — to sustain that enviable position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than one-tenth of research funding at British universities has come from the EU in recent years. Some fields — such as nanotechnology and cancer research — are more dependent on EU funding than others, according to a report by technology firm Digital Science. From 2007 to 2013, Britain received 8.8 billion euros ($9.4 billion) in direct EU investment in research.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bagniewska is not just anxious about herself — she&#8217;s upset for her students&#8217; future too, for the opportunities that both Britons and foreigners will likely miss out on when unfettered mobility between Britain and Europe can no longer be taken for granted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;They were just getting excited about doing their masters and Ph.Ds in other countries. And then Brexit happened and they just got trampled,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scientists and researchers argue that being part of the EU has given British science a huge boost because it allows Britain to recruit the best talent across Europe and take part in important research collaborations and student exchanges without being constrained by national boundaries. The bloc&#8217;s freedom of movement means its 500 million people can live and work visa-free in any member state.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one knows yet what form Britain&#8217;s exit from the EU — commonly known as Brexit — is going to take, but immigration was a key issue for &#8220;Leave&#8221; voters. Many believe some limit should be put on the number of EU citizens moving to Britain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to reassert control over British borders. She has offered no firm guarantees for the rights of Europeans already living in Britain, an uncertainty that weighs heavily over the 32,000 Europeans who make up 16 percent of the academic workforce in British universities. Many universities say the rhetoric over immigration control is also jeopardizing recruitment of researchers and students from further afield.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scientists for EU, an advocacy group, says it has received over 400 letters from researchers describing how Brexit has already impacted their life and work. Some are losing doctoral students who pulled out of studentships and job offers. Academics are putting plans to relocate to Britain on hold. One said their employer, a London university, immediately imposed a temporary hiring freeze, citing uncertainties about student recruitment and research income.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adam Durrant, a British entrepreneur who founded an aerospace startup supplying climate data to airlines and aircraft manufacturers, says he&#8217;s now considering moving some of his business to a EU country outside of Britain. Part of the reason, he says, is that Brexit will likely make hiring the right people much harder than before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;In the future, it probably means that people would be less interested to come to the U.K. to work,&#8221; said Durrant. &#8220;There&#8217;s a huge question mark over my company and my own personal future. I will certainly retain a U.K. presence, but my company&#8217;s focus of gravity may shift elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scientists say some U.K.-based researchers are already being excluded from joint bids for EU funding to minimize the risks for their colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul Crowther, head of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield, said a researcher from his department was dropped from an EU grant proposal as a precaution following the Brexit referendum. The vote &#8220;put the U.K.-based researchers in a very awkward position&#8221; and their participation in EU-funded programs could &#8220;compromise the project,&#8221; he was told.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The erosion of U.K. involvement in EU networks has already begun, with both the U.K. and EU science worse off,&#8221; Crowther said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from a loss of grant money, Brexit will likely cause British scientists and research centers to miss out on shared databases and infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Large-scale efforts like studies of rare genetic diseases, the building of large facilities, are areas that multinational collaborations do much better,&#8221; said Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist and president of Britain&#8217;s prestigious Royal Society.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The EU is an important source of research funding for Britain, which lags behind many developed countries in state investment in science. In 2014, Britain&#8217;s government spent under 0.5 percent of its GDP on research — below the European average, and half that of South Korea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May&#8217;s government is clearly aware of the jitters. She has promised to increase annual investment in research by 2 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) by 2020, in hopes her country can remain a world leader in science and innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Durrant is doubtful that&#8217;s enough to make a big difference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Two billion a year spread across everything isn&#8217;t going to go very far,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Similar anxieties are being felt at the undergraduate level. The 125,000 European students studying at British universities now pay the same fees as locals and have access to the same government loans. Officials have promised this will not change for those applying next year — but no one knows what will happen after that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fewer European students appeared to be applying for some of Britain&#8217;s most competitive university courses, including medicine and places at Oxford and Cambridge. In September, the admission service UCAS reported a 9 percent drop in EU applications for British undergraduate courses starting in 2017.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some argue that Britain could become like Switzerland, an &#8220;associate&#8221; EU state that is opting out of free movement of people while still taking part in limited European science projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom — but it will be harder,&#8221; Ramakrishnan said. &#8220;We could make a go of it outside the EU. But for that to happen, we have to attract talent and fund science. And those two things are critical.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>My interview for the <a href="https://soapboxscience.org/?p=3321">Soapbox Science blog</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Joanna Bagniewska is a zoologist working as a teaching fellow at <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/biologicalsciences/about/staff/j-m-bagniewska.aspx">Reading </a>University’s School of Biological Sciences. Her research interests encompass ecology and conservation biology, particularly the subject of invasive species. She is a very keen science communicator – she won FameLab Poland, gave a talk at TEDxWarsaw, and she even does science stand-up comedy.  Meet Joanna in our <a href="https://soapboxscience.org/?page_id=2560">Reading </a>event, where she’ll be discussing <em>“How Disney &amp; Science don’t always go hand in hand”.</em></p>
<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: Joanna, how did you get to your current position?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: While completing my undergraduate in Biology at Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany, I did an internship with the University of New South Wales. I spent two months in Australia’s Snowy Mountains examining road ecology – i.e. the impact of roads on the surrounding wildlife. I found the subject absolutely fascinating, and from that point onwards I knew that I wanted to research ecology and conservation biology. To get more international experience, I decided to spend a semester abroad at Rice University in Texas, where I obtained a lot of hands-on experience in herpetology and animal behaviour. After completing my undergraduate degree, I went on to obtain my MSc from Oxford University; my research focused on the methods used for monitoring South African canid species, such as jackals and foxes. I then stayed at Oxford for my doctorate, which examined the behavioural ecology of the American mink in the UK. After graduating, I worked for a start-up company for a few months, and then went on to be a lecturer at Nottingham Trent University. Eventually I moved back to West Midlands to take the post of a teaching fellow at Reading University’s School of Biological Sciences.</p>
<p><span id="more-1502"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: What, or who, inspired you to get a career in science?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: My earliest inspiration came from countless books on animals that I received from my parents when I was very little. I’ve always had very diverse interests, and up until the very end of high school I wasn’t sure what to study. I was torn between studying architecture (like my mother), Chinese language (because I lived in China for a few years) and animal science (because I really liked animals). Eventually I settled for biology, even though it was my weakest subject in school – mainly because I was very passionate about wildlife, but not any of the other aspects of the curriculum! Going to university was pretty much the default option in my family, but as I was the first one to choose a science degree, my parents were very apprehensive – they did not think that biology was a viable career choice. In fact, it was only when I went to South Africa with my students last year, my mother finally admitted “wow, you really do have the coolest job in the world”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: What is the most fascinating aspect of your research/work?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: There are several. Making sense of the world around us, interacting with animals, travelling, and finally meeting inspirational and passionate people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: What attracted you to Soapbox Science in the first place?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: Talking to people about what animals do is one of my favourite activities of all time. Well, that and ceilidhs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: Sum up in one word your expectations for the day – excitement? Fear? Thrill? Anticipation?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: Woohoo!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: If you could change one thing about the scientific culture right now, what would it be?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: The lack of stability. I understand that mobility is good for science, but I really don’t think it’s that good for scientists. We’re not science automatons – we’re people, we want to have relationships, start families, have a good night’s sleep without worrying about where our money will come from tomorrow. Continuous searches for funding, applying for grants, looking for jobs is what really sucks the fun out of science. Currently in some scientific circles revealing that you have a life outside of academia leads to, in the best case, a few funny looks, in the worst – being labelled a weak scientist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: What would be your top recommendation to a female PhD student considering pursuing a career in academia?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: I have a dilemma here. The optimistic advice would be: believe in what you do, be kind to everyone, and build a supportive contact network around you. The truly heartfelt (although painful) advice would be: find a rich husband/wife, prepare for an extremely competitive environment with very little money to go around, and always have an escape plan. I know the second set sounds incredibly harsh, but when I look back at my academic career, I wish someone had given me a reality check like this – not to put me down, but to really allow me to prepare myself for any worst case scenarios.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>An article by Peter Hughes in <a href="https://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/14420894.Can_science_save_football__Boffins_believe_they_can_make_the_beautiful_game_more_beautiful/">The Oxford Times</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AS 33,000 Oxford United fans packed the stands at Wembley this month, many were praying for victory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But a football-mad Oxford scientist has suggested that loving the beautiful game is more of a science than a religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Science Oxford&#8217;s creative director Quentin Cooper joined a panel of footie-loving celebrity scientists to debate how scientific improvements could make the beautiful game even more beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a talk called &#8220;Can Science Save Football?&#8221; at The Old Fire Station on March 31, the experts discussed corruption, injustice and big money in football, revealing how a scientific approach could make things better.</p>
<div class="advert-container tiny" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p><span id="more-1394"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Cooper, a veteran science journalist and Manchester City fan, was joined by Oxford University Professor for the Public Understanding of Science Marcus du Sautoy, Radio 4 science presenter Jim Al-Khalili, University of Reading zoologist Joanna Bagniewska and University of Cambridge statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The panel discussed putting microchips into players&#8217; kit to track who last touched the ball, using smart phones for better crowd safety, and generating data to inform fairness in the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Cooper, who lives in Princes Risborough, said: &#8220;Fans love to moan, but if we have a problem let’s think about how we can solve it: that’s what science does.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;So the question is: can we apply a bit of mind power to make the game fairer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Cooper said the goal of science to make the world a better place could be just as productive on the football pitch as in a laboratory trying to cure cancer or send astronauts to Mars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He added: &#8220;There’s lots of football fans out there who feel like the game has fallen a bit into disarray.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Science is trying to make the world a better place and solve problems, so maybe a scientific approach can help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The weird thing is that some people say they’re not interested in science, but whatever they are into there will be an element of science to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Whether it’s football, knitting, gardening or whatever, I defy you to come up with any subject that doesn’t have a scientific element.</p>
<div class="advert-container tiny" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;People think they don’t like science, but secretly they do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Cooper insisted that many scientists like him shared a love of football and sports as well as their professional pursuits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He added: &#8220;That’s not the public perception of science, but we&#8217;re people too. We may be very logical about our research but we can still be potty about football.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to a game with Marcus du Sautoy &#8211; he’s not just sitting there thinking about numbers, he’s up and shouting in the stands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Lots of scientists are very passionate about the game.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/nature.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-582" src="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/nature.png" alt="nature" width="500" height="376" /></a></p>
<p>When the organisers of the first Science Polish Perspetives conference (SPP) &#8211; held last year in Oxford &#8211; announced there was going to be a sequel, the expectations were running high. Those two autumn days spent in the neoclassical Magdalen Grove Auditorium, buzzing with popular science talks, panel discussions, poster sessions and social interactions, left the participants dizzy with excitement and gasping for more. If anyone had wondered whether the unusual concept of a conference bringing together scientists linked solely by a shared national background (but open to the whole English-speaking world) would succeed or not, the answer was a resounding yes.</p>
<p>This was largely thanks to the organisers, marshalling the tight conference schedule like air traffic controllers. It was two of these organisers, Magdalena Richter and Tomasz Cebo that took on the task of following this class act by bringing SPP to Cambridge in 2013, supported by a new team of enthusiastic Polish researchers Ewelina Gregolińska, Kinga Pławik, Ola Kołodziejczyk, Paweł Jaworski and Piotr Oleśkiewicz. In a fantastic feat of modern technology, the organising team managed to bring the whole event together without ever meeting in person until the day of the conference.</p>
<p>And so we are in Cambridge, the town of Wittgenstein and Hawking, with its quaint colleges, cobbled streets and an unimaginable abundance of relics of scientific history, from a bridge allegedly designed by Newton himself to the pub in which Watson and Crick celebrated the double helix. This well-preserved abundance is what makes places like Cambridge seem unreal, especially to a Polish mind, accustomed to mementos of the past being quickly wiped away in the course of a turbulent history.</p>
<p>The talks are short: 15 min for the students and 30 min for the keynote speakers, followed in both cases by a short question session. There are also panel discussions, lively and engaging, covering different aspects of the organisation of science in Poland, and workshops, a new addition to the programme. The overall standard of the student talks seems even higher than last year and most speakers put effort into making their presentations accessible and entertaining, veering away from the regular scientific format for specialised audiences and more akin to the TED lecture style. This supports the interdisciplinary approach of the conference in a very real sense, people from different disciplines actually being able to follow all of the talks and discuss them during the breaks. As for the topics, however, the speakers take no hostages, their subjects ranging from quantum mechanics to cellular trafficking to human memory. This is what makes SPP fascinating.</p>
<p>Unlike the students, the keynote speakers and most panellists come directly from Poland, consistent with one of the objectives of the conference being to bring together the best Polish junior scientists working abroad and the distinguished senior ones working back home. As the old-fashioned virtues of the older scientists are complemented by the enthusiasm of the young, the morale at the meeting is flying high.</p>
<p>Among the invited guests there are also representatives of Polish funding bodies and other organisations, as well as sponsors, the main one being the Warsaw office of Boston Consulting Group. The prizes for the most impressive student talks go to Agnieszka Lekawa-Raus (Cambridge), Michał Kępa (Edinburgh) and Joanna Bagniewska (Nottingham Trent), while Krzysztof Kozak (Cambridge), Jakub Bochiński (Open University) and Tomasz Augustynek (Leicester) are awarded for the best contributions to the poster session.</p>
<p>Like last year, and as with all good conferences, an equally important part of the conference happens outside of the lecture room over countless cups of tea or coffee, and even more glasses of wine. The formal dinner in Corpus Christi College is, not surprisingly, a huge success, and &#8211; the participants heading off afterwards to one of Cambridge clubs &#8211; is just a prelude to an evening of joyful celebration.</p>
<p>Science used to be considered something set apart, a unique type of activity completely neutral with respect to human considerations. However, since Thomas Kuhn&#8217;s consideration of the social impact of science, we have been aware that it is in many ways a human activity like any other. The personal aspects of research, and the interactions of those involved can be just as important for the resultant intellectual value as the what and how. With this realisation in mind, conferences such as this &#8211; where the scientists group together according to cultural and not just purely scientific criteria &#8211; are an exciting complement to the more usual academic conference crowds. This is a concept that has been strongly illustrated here at SPP 2013.</p>
