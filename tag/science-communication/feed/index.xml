										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>My interview for the <a href="https://soapboxscience.org/?p=3321">Soapbox Science blog</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Joanna Bagniewska is a zoologist working as a teaching fellow at <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/biologicalsciences/about/staff/j-m-bagniewska.aspx">Reading </a>University’s School of Biological Sciences. Her research interests encompass ecology and conservation biology, particularly the subject of invasive species. She is a very keen science communicator – she won FameLab Poland, gave a talk at TEDxWarsaw, and she even does science stand-up comedy.  Meet Joanna in our <a href="https://soapboxscience.org/?page_id=2560">Reading </a>event, where she’ll be discussing <em>“How Disney &amp; Science don’t always go hand in hand”.</em></p>
<div class="entry-content">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: Joanna, how did you get to your current position?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: While completing my undergraduate in Biology at Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany, I did an internship with the University of New South Wales. I spent two months in Australia’s Snowy Mountains examining road ecology – i.e. the impact of roads on the surrounding wildlife. I found the subject absolutely fascinating, and from that point onwards I knew that I wanted to research ecology and conservation biology. To get more international experience, I decided to spend a semester abroad at Rice University in Texas, where I obtained a lot of hands-on experience in herpetology and animal behaviour. After completing my undergraduate degree, I went on to obtain my MSc from Oxford University; my research focused on the methods used for monitoring South African canid species, such as jackals and foxes. I then stayed at Oxford for my doctorate, which examined the behavioural ecology of the American mink in the UK. After graduating, I worked for a start-up company for a few months, and then went on to be a lecturer at Nottingham Trent University. Eventually I moved back to West Midlands to take the post of a teaching fellow at Reading University’s School of Biological Sciences.</p>
<p><span id="more-1502"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: What, or who, inspired you to get a career in science?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: My earliest inspiration came from countless books on animals that I received from my parents when I was very little. I’ve always had very diverse interests, and up until the very end of high school I wasn’t sure what to study. I was torn between studying architecture (like my mother), Chinese language (because I lived in China for a few years) and animal science (because I really liked animals). Eventually I settled for biology, even though it was my weakest subject in school – mainly because I was very passionate about wildlife, but not any of the other aspects of the curriculum! Going to university was pretty much the default option in my family, but as I was the first one to choose a science degree, my parents were very apprehensive – they did not think that biology was a viable career choice. In fact, it was only when I went to South Africa with my students last year, my mother finally admitted “wow, you really do have the coolest job in the world”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: What is the most fascinating aspect of your research/work?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: There are several. Making sense of the world around us, interacting with animals, travelling, and finally meeting inspirational and passionate people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: What attracted you to Soapbox Science in the first place?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: Talking to people about what animals do is one of my favourite activities of all time. Well, that and ceilidhs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: Sum up in one word your expectations for the day – excitement? Fear? Thrill? Anticipation?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: Woohoo!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: If you could change one thing about the scientific culture right now, what would it be?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: The lack of stability. I understand that mobility is good for science, but I really don’t think it’s that good for scientists. We’re not science automatons – we’re people, we want to have relationships, start families, have a good night’s sleep without worrying about where our money will come from tomorrow. Continuous searches for funding, applying for grants, looking for jobs is what really sucks the fun out of science. Currently in some scientific circles revealing that you have a life outside of academia leads to, in the best case, a few funny looks, in the worst – being labelled a weak scientist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>SS: What would be your top recommendation to a female PhD student considering pursuing a career in academia?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">JB: I have a dilemma here. The optimistic advice would be: believe in what you do, be kind to everyone, and build a supportive contact network around you. The truly heartfelt (although painful) advice would be: find a rich husband/wife, prepare for an extremely competitive environment with very little money to go around, and always have an escape plan. I know the second set sounds incredibly harsh, but when I look back at my academic career, I wish someone had given me a reality check like this – not to put me down, but to really allow me to prepare myself for any worst case scenarios.</p>

<p>Would you let a zoologist tell you the truth about the animals in Disney films? Warning: you might not be able to watch them in the same way ever again.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what The University of Reading&#8217;s Dr Joanna Bagniewska will be doing at a Soapbox Science event at Reading town centre next weekend.</p>
<p>She will be telling children how Baloo from The Jungle Book isn&#8217;t as cuddly as he seems, and that Simba and Nala from The Lion King could actually be brother and sister &#8211; yeah, our minds are blown too.</p>
<p>The talk titled, How Disney and Science don’t always go hand in hand, is just one of the events sharing weird and wonderful facts at the science takeover in Reading on Saturday, July 9.</p>
<p>Bringing together professors from an array of environmental fields, the aim of the day is to promote female scientists who will be talking to audiences about some of the projects and ideas they have worked on.</p>
<p>Following the format of London Hyde Park’s Speaker’s Corner, the talks will run from midday to 3pm in Broad Street outside Sainsbury&#8217;s.</p>
<h3>For now, take a look at these fascinating facts &#8211; just some of things you can discover on the day</h3>
<ol>
<li>Overflows of untreated sewage into the River Thames adds up to tens of millions of tonnes every year. Each year, enough sewage discharges into the River Thames to fill the Albert Hall 450 times over.</li>
<li>The levels of drug materials found in rivers are used to estimate the amount of drugs consumed in towns and cities.</li>
<li>Mammals with large brains are more vulnerable to extinction. Big brains may help humans, but are bad news for other mammals.</li>
<li>Palm oil is found in about 50 per cent of all packaged supermarket products, from your peanut butter to your soap.</li>
<li>14 out of the 18 different species of bat species found in the UK have been recorded in Berkshire and South Buckinghamshire.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="inline-image clearfix "><img loading="lazy" title="There are currently 18 species of bat living in the UK." src="https://i2.getreading.co.uk/incoming/article10058201.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/bat.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="307" /><figcaption>There are currently 18 species of bat living in the UK.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Great science communicators can help bridge the gulf between scientists and the public, and the finalists at Famelab International last week showed how it&#8217;s done.</strong><br />
<span id="more-704"></span></p>
<p>It was not exactly Eurovision, but it surely bore many of the same hallmarks: flags from various countries, anxious contestants rehearsing their acts, a presenter checking his script, an empty, floodlit stage as the audience took their seats in the hall. Singing and dancing were not expected (though they are neither forbidden nor discouraged). After all, the contestants were scientists not singers. But they were definitely performers, and they had come to the Cheltenham Science Festival last week to compete in Famelab International for the title of best &#8220;stand-up scientist&#8221; in the world.</p>
<p>Famelab was founded in the UK by the Cheltenham Science Festival in 2005, but since 2007 it has expanded in partnership with the British Council to 23 countries across every continent, attracting more than 6,000 entrants and reaching millions through traditional and digital media.</p>
<p>The brainchild of science communicators Frank Burnet and Kathy Sykes, Famelab seeks to bring science into the mainstream by subverting the talent competition idea. The young contestants have three minutes to explain a scientific theme in front of a live audience. Props are allowed, providing the contestant can carry them on stage and set them up quickly. Presentations are judged by a jury who ask questions around the theme, and ultimately decide who will bear the coveted title of &#8220;Famelab International winner&#8221;.</p>
<figure class="element element-image"><img loading="lazy" class="gu-image" src="https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402073835317/d5c2616c-40fd-444b-a865-e1c9a4028a5d-460x276.jpeg" alt="Jennifer Fowlie at the 2014 Famelab International finals" width="460" height="276" /><figcaption>Jennifer Fowlie, representing Switzerland.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why go to all this trouble? Why take young talented scientists out of their labs, where they were presumably doing good for the world, coach them like wannabe actors, then hurl them into the lions&#8217; den of public exposure?</p>
<p>Perhaps the answer lies in the famous 1959 &#8220;Two Cultures&#8221; lecture by C P Snow, in which he lamented the gap between the sciences and the humanities. Snow noted how science was increasingly becoming unintelligible to the wider public, which in a democracy could be troublesome.</p>
<p>Recent years have witnessed a series of bitter culture wars over science, from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to stem cells, and from climate change to vaccines that purportedly caused autism. In all these wars, points were scored by those who could access the literary arsenal of the humanities and use it to their advantage. Rhetoric often weighed heavier than facts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the media oversimplified, sensationalised and polarised. GMOs were called &#8220;Frankenstein food&#8221;; scientists were depicted as eccentric men on a bad hair day; and human cloning stories were accompanied by a photo of Hitler, like a reflex.</p>
<p>For many in the science camp, letting outsiders frame the scientific agenda and drive public opinion had gone too far. Science had to reclaim its cultural relevance. And that meant that science had to start making sense to the unscientific majority.</p>
<figure class="element element-image"><img loading="lazy" class="gu-image" src="https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402073512644/991239c4-7b73-4a16-a0f8-7edad9d8eac7-460x276.jpeg" alt="2014 Famelab International finals, David Davila representing France" width="460" height="276" /><figcaption>Runner-up David Davila, representing France, explained how language takes shape in the brain.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, since the Two Cultures lecture, much has been achieved to bridge the gap. In the 1980s, Carl Sagan&#8217;s TV series Cosmos revealed the beauty of scientific understanding to generations of young people, many of whom were inspired to become scientists too. It was an amazing success, and remains to this day the most widely watched PBS series in the world.</p>
<p>In Britain, too, science is nowadays presented by a new generation of scientists-turned-TV personalities, such as Jim Al-Khalili and Alice Roberts (the two other judges in this year&#8217;s Famelab International, with me), and of course Brian Cox. Science is not just for the nerds any more. TV shows such as The Big Bang Theory have tens of millions of viewers. Nerdy and sciencey are the new sexy.</p>
<p>So how do you decide who gets the Famelab prize? From a judge&#8217;s point of view this is never easy. There were 10 finalists who performed on the night, young minds who had undergone a gruelling series of heats, semi-finals and science communication training. For most of them it had been a transformative experience. Decoding the mathematical language of science and translating it to an interesting story is far from trivial.</p>
<figure class="element element-image"><img loading="lazy" class="gu-image" src="https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/6/1402073695481/dfbda09a-f2d3-43d2-8ebf-69692b3582cc-460x276.jpeg" alt="Famelab International 2014 winner Padraic Flood" width="460" height="276" /><figcaption>Padraic Flood, an Irishman representing the Benelux countries, explained how manipulating photosynthesis could help feed the world.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the runners-up, David Davila, representing France, explained how language takes shape in the brain by speaking and signing at the same time, making the point that language can take many forms.</p>
<p>The zoologist Joanna Bagniewska from Poland revealed how bees can be trained to detect explosives and illicit drugs, and how they are so many times better at this than sniffer dogs. Other subjects included the mathematics of a leopard&#8217;s dots, the evolutionary roots of dancing, and how stem cells could cure dementia.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, we decided to give the top prize to an Irishman representing the tripartite Benelux. By telling us how manipulating photosynthesis could help to feed the billions of people in our world, Padraic Flood showed how a single idea in a person&#8217;s head, inspired by the meticulous observation of nature, can make the world a better place. These will always be among the greatest stories ever told.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NOTTINGHAM Trent University academic Dr Joanna Bagniewska has made it into the international rounds of a science communication competition.</p>
<p><span id="more-669"></span>Joanna, a lecturer in wildlife conservation in the university&#8217;s School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences, will compete against more than 25 other contestants after winning the national final of FameLab in her native Poland.</p>
<p>The event challenges researchers to present a topic in science, engineering or maths in an engaging way to a non-specialist audience in just three minutes.</p>
<p>Her topic was &#8220;The curious incident of testicles at night time&#8221;, examining the influence of the melatonin hormone on the physiology of humans and other animals.</p>
<p>FameLab aims to &#8220;find the new voice of science and engineering across the world&#8221;.</p>
<p>Joanna, who will be representing Poland in the international round, said: &#8220;I am very pleased with the result, particularly because I usually do not use Polish to talk science.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a challenge and a wonderful adventure, and I am looking forward to representing my country and Nottingham Trent University in the international rounds.&#8221;</p>

<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">An academic at Nottingham Trent University has made the international rounds of a science communication competition – which challenges researchers to present a topic to a non-specialist audience in just three minutes.<span id="more-655"></span></p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">Dr Joanna Bagniewska, a lecturer in wildlife conservation in the University&#8217;s School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences, will compete against more than 25 other contestants after winning the national final of &#8216;FameLab&#8217; in her native Poland.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">Her topic was &#8216;The curious incident of testicles at night time&#8217;, examining the influence of the melatonin hormone on the physiology of humans and other animals.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">FameLab aims to &#8216;find the new voice of science and engineering across the world&#8217;.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">Contestants have just three minutes to present a topic in science, engineering or maths in an engaging way – without PowerPoint and with limited props &#8211; and judges are looking for those who shine in content, clarity and charisma.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">Joanna, who will be representing Poland in the international round, said: &#8220;I am very pleased with the result, particularly because I usually do not use Polish to &#8216;talk science&#8217;.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a challenge and a wonderful adventure, and I am looking forward to representing my country and Nottingham Trent University in the international rounds.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e;">The international rounds will take place on 5 June at The Times Cheltenham Science Festival.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dr Joanna Bagniewska, a zoologist from Nottingham Trent University, will represent Poland during the international final of FameLab, a competition for young researchers.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-598"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How to share the results of research that has taken months or even years to get done if you have only three minutes’ time? That’s no easy task, and one that many luminaries of science keep stumbling over, too. FameLab has raised delivering such ultrashort speeches to the level of art. The competition rewards the most charismatic young researchers who manage to thrill the audience while explaining their mission within 180 seconds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Staged for the first time in the UK in 2005, FameLab has now its national editions in over twenty countries across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. This year’s was the third edition to be organized in Poland. Out of the seventy entrants who took part in the competition, three were named as the laureates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are used to presenting our research results to scientists during specialist conferences. But here we can try and learn to talk to laypeople, which for me is a very valuable experience,” Dr Joanna Bagniewska, the winner of the Polish edition of FameLab, told Poland.gov.pl. In early June she will travel to Cheltenham in the UK to represent Poland during the international final of the contest. “People should be able to understand what we do, working as we do for public money,” added Dr Bagniewska.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img title="FameLab1, Kalendarium 2014" src="https://foto.poland.gov.pl/gallery/Kalendarium_2014/FameLab1.jpg" alt="FameLab1, Kalendarium 2014" width="450" /></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A University of Oxford graduate, Dr Bagniewska teaches ecology and biodiversity at Nottingham Trent University. One of her areas of interest is biotelemetry, or the observation of animals in their natural habitats; she has also examined bees’ ability to detect drugs. Entitled “A dark predicament. What dangers to men lurk at night?”, her presentation dealt with research showing that the large amount of melatonin, or sleep hormone, being produced at night make males’ testicles shrink. Although the research was done on hamsters, news of the potential threat to men soon travelled around the world. This went to show that results of tests on animals should be analysed with caution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second prize went to Justyna Lesiak, a PhD student from Munich University. She talked about Clostridium, a genus of bacteria she has researched which could soon provide a cure for tumours that are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Moreover, Justyna Lesiak was presented with special awards of the Minister of Science and Higher Education, and BASF Poland, as well as the audience award funded by the British Council, which co-organized the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The third laureate, Tomasz Jakubek, is a chemist from the Jagiellonian University. His presentation discussed catalysts that lower combustion temperature, and thus eliminate harmful soot which is a by-product of coal burning. Tomasz Jakubek was also awarded two special prizes by BMW Group Poland and BASF.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This year’s edition of FameLab was dominated by biologists, chemists, and biotechnologists, whereas last year it was engineers, physicists and mathematicians who called the shots. We are happy to see more and more people with advanced scientific degrees send in their applications,” Paulina Butlewska of the Copernicus Science Centre’s Communication and Promotion Division, which co-organized FameLab, told Poland.gov.pl. She added that each edition was at a higher level than the previous one, with scientists being more adept at preparing themselves for the competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/ntu-press.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-585" src="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/ntu-press.png" alt="NTU-press" width="500" height="327" /></a></p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">NTU lecturer Joanna Bagniewska is through to the final of a prestigious science competition called FameLab in her native country of Poland, and we caught up with her to find out a bit more about the competition and also the interesting topic she chose to speak about…</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;"><strong>Hello Joanna, could we start by asking what is involved in FameLab? Is it a very popular competition?</strong></p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">FameLab is an international science communication competition, where scientists, engineers and medics have three minutes to present about a scientific subject of their choice, without the aid of PowerPoint (though props are allowed). The competition started in the UK in 2005, has steadily grown in popularity and is now a global event with over 20 countries hosting their own competitions.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;"><span id="more-584"></span>In January, I entered the British edition of FameLab, prompted by an invitation from one of the organisers, who saw me give a talk at a conference last November. I entered the heats for the Midlands area, and ended being the runner-up finalist for the region, narrowly missing out on the national final.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">Still, I was very pleased to reach the top 20, as the British edition is known to be the most difficult one in the world, as science communication is well-established in this country.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">In February I went on to try my luck in FameLab Poland – as I’m Polish, and I wanted to give science communication a go in my native language (which was surprisingly difficult, as I have not spoken about science in Polish since my high school days). At the beginning of March I reached the national semi-finals, and went on to make the finals &#8211; these are taking place in May, in Warsaw, so please keep your fingers crossed for me!</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;"><strong>Tell us about the subject you chose to speak about, ‘Why do plants scream?’  &#8211; it certainly sounds like an interesting topic?</strong></p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">I chose to talk about plant communication – even though I am a zoologist – as I like plants a lot, and feel that they’re not getting enough attention, most people seem to find them boring! Therefore I try to take all opportunities to show the fascinating lives of plants – how they react to predators, how they &#8216;talk&#8217; to each other and what cunning methods they use to protect themselves.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">To try and explain a little further – lots of people think of plants as quite benign organisms. But when attacked, plants actually start to scream! They don&#8217;t scream like we do, though – they scream chemically.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">When a herbivore bites into plant leaves, the leaves can release volatile signals that fly through the air and tell other organisms that an attacker is coming. These signals can trigger a plant&#8217;s defence reaction (blocking the enzymes of the herbivore so that it can&#8217;t digest its food), but also they serve as an alarm call for predators and parasites, who come and gang up on the herbivore.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">If, for instance, a caterpillar starts nibbling on the leaves of tomato plants, the tomatoes will call on carnivorous ants to come to their defence. So its a lot more interesting than most people would imagine, when you delve into the scientific detail.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">In the next round I will address a different topic (rules state that the presentations for each round must clearly differ); and I’m considering talking about sleep patterns this time.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;"><strong>Have you had much experience of public speaking or competitions? Would you recommend taking part in Famelab?</strong></p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve had previous public speaking and science communication experiences; last year I gave a talk about invasive species at TEDxWarsaw. Still, I think events such as FameLab provide a great opportunity to learn more – I strongly urge NTU students and staff to take part in next year&#8217;s edition; it&#8217;s a wonderful experience, and the organisers offer a free workshop on public speaking skills which I have found extremely useful. Furthermore, it&#8217;s a great opportunity to try science communication in a friendly, supportive atmosphere.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;"><strong>FameLab is not your only recent claim to fame is it? We&#8217;ve heard that you have been recognised for your work in the Polish community in the UK?<br />
</strong><br />
No, I suppose it isn&#8217;t! Over the past few years I have been involved in work with the Polish diaspora in the UK and in other countries. During my doctorate at Oxford I presided over the Oxford University Polish Society, I established the Federation of Polish Student Societies in the UK, and was involved in proposing changes to the Polish higher education system.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">My work has been recognised by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 8 March, during the 7th Congress of Polish Student Societies in Oxford, Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, presented me with a white-and-red checkerboard of the Polish Air Forces, a symbol of the Polish community in the UK, in recognition of my work with Poles abroad.</p>
<p style="color: #4e4e4e; text-align: justify;">I was very proud to be recognised to be recognised in this way and keen to support the Polish community here. So, if any Poles would like to get in touch, or start a society at NTU, I would be more than happy to help.</p>

<p><a href="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/nature.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-582" src="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/nature.png" alt="nature" width="500" height="376" /></a></p>
<p>When the organisers of the first Science Polish Perspetives conference (SPP) &#8211; held last year in Oxford &#8211; announced there was going to be a sequel, the expectations were running high. Those two autumn days spent in the neoclassical Magdalen Grove Auditorium, buzzing with popular science talks, panel discussions, poster sessions and social interactions, left the participants dizzy with excitement and gasping for more. If anyone had wondered whether the unusual concept of a conference bringing together scientists linked solely by a shared national background (but open to the whole English-speaking world) would succeed or not, the answer was a resounding yes.</p>
<p>This was largely thanks to the organisers, marshalling the tight conference schedule like air traffic controllers. It was two of these organisers, Magdalena Richter and Tomasz Cebo that took on the task of following this class act by bringing SPP to Cambridge in 2013, supported by a new team of enthusiastic Polish researchers Ewelina Gregolińska, Kinga Pławik, Ola Kołodziejczyk, Paweł Jaworski and Piotr Oleśkiewicz. In a fantastic feat of modern technology, the organising team managed to bring the whole event together without ever meeting in person until the day of the conference.</p>
<p>And so we are in Cambridge, the town of Wittgenstein and Hawking, with its quaint colleges, cobbled streets and an unimaginable abundance of relics of scientific history, from a bridge allegedly designed by Newton himself to the pub in which Watson and Crick celebrated the double helix. This well-preserved abundance is what makes places like Cambridge seem unreal, especially to a Polish mind, accustomed to mementos of the past being quickly wiped away in the course of a turbulent history.</p>
<p>The talks are short: 15 min for the students and 30 min for the keynote speakers, followed in both cases by a short question session. There are also panel discussions, lively and engaging, covering different aspects of the organisation of science in Poland, and workshops, a new addition to the programme. The overall standard of the student talks seems even higher than last year and most speakers put effort into making their presentations accessible and entertaining, veering away from the regular scientific format for specialised audiences and more akin to the TED lecture style. This supports the interdisciplinary approach of the conference in a very real sense, people from different disciplines actually being able to follow all of the talks and discuss them during the breaks. As for the topics, however, the speakers take no hostages, their subjects ranging from quantum mechanics to cellular trafficking to human memory. This is what makes SPP fascinating.</p>
<p>Unlike the students, the keynote speakers and most panellists come directly from Poland, consistent with one of the objectives of the conference being to bring together the best Polish junior scientists working abroad and the distinguished senior ones working back home. As the old-fashioned virtues of the older scientists are complemented by the enthusiasm of the young, the morale at the meeting is flying high.</p>
<p>Among the invited guests there are also representatives of Polish funding bodies and other organisations, as well as sponsors, the main one being the Warsaw office of Boston Consulting Group. The prizes for the most impressive student talks go to Agnieszka Lekawa-Raus (Cambridge), Michał Kępa (Edinburgh) and Joanna Bagniewska (Nottingham Trent), while Krzysztof Kozak (Cambridge), Jakub Bochiński (Open University) and Tomasz Augustynek (Leicester) are awarded for the best contributions to the poster session.</p>
<p>Like last year, and as with all good conferences, an equally important part of the conference happens outside of the lecture room over countless cups of tea or coffee, and even more glasses of wine. The formal dinner in Corpus Christi College is, not surprisingly, a huge success, and &#8211; the participants heading off afterwards to one of Cambridge clubs &#8211; is just a prelude to an evening of joyful celebration.</p>
<p>Science used to be considered something set apart, a unique type of activity completely neutral with respect to human considerations. However, since Thomas Kuhn&#8217;s consideration of the social impact of science, we have been aware that it is in many ways a human activity like any other. The personal aspects of research, and the interactions of those involved can be just as important for the resultant intellectual value as the what and how. With this realisation in mind, conferences such as this &#8211; where the scientists group together according to cultural and not just purely scientific criteria &#8211; are an exciting complement to the more usual academic conference crowds. This is a concept that has been strongly illustrated here at SPP 2013.</p>
