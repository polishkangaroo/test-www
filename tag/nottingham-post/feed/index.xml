<p>WILDLIFE conservation lecturer Dr Joanna Bagniewska has won a top award in the international final of a science communication competition.</p>
<p><span id="more-749"></span>Joanna, of Nottingham Trent University, won the International Alumni Award at the FameLab 2014 International Final for her talk on &#8216;bomber bees&#8217;, which explored how honeybees can be used to detect explosives and drugs.</p>
<p>FameLab International challenges researchers to present a topic to a non-specialist audience in just three minutes and is judged on content, clarity and charisma. The prize won by Joanna was voted for by FameLab alumni from previous years.</p>
<p>Joanna reached the international rounds after winning the national final in her native Poland.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;I feel very proud of this award and am extremely pleased to have got as far as I did. The standard of the competitors was very high, so I did not expect to win an award, especially not such a prestigious one.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NOTTINGHAM Trent University academic Dr Joanna Bagniewska has made it into the international rounds of a science communication competition.</p>
<p><span id="more-669"></span>Joanna, a lecturer in wildlife conservation in the university&#8217;s School of Animal, Rural and Environmental Sciences, will compete against more than 25 other contestants after winning the national final of FameLab in her native Poland.</p>
<p>The event challenges researchers to present a topic in science, engineering or maths in an engaging way to a non-specialist audience in just three minutes.</p>
<p>Her topic was &#8220;The curious incident of testicles at night time&#8221;, examining the influence of the melatonin hormone on the physiology of humans and other animals.</p>
<p>FameLab aims to &#8220;find the new voice of science and engineering across the world&#8221;.</p>
<p>Joanna, who will be representing Poland in the international round, said: &#8220;I am very pleased with the result, particularly because I usually do not use Polish to talk science.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a challenge and a wonderful adventure, and I am looking forward to representing my country and Nottingham Trent University in the international rounds.&#8221;</p>
