										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>An article by Peter Hughes in <a href="https://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/14420894.Can_science_save_football__Boffins_believe_they_can_make_the_beautiful_game_more_beautiful/">The Oxford Times</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AS 33,000 Oxford United fans packed the stands at Wembley this month, many were praying for victory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But a football-mad Oxford scientist has suggested that loving the beautiful game is more of a science than a religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Science Oxford&#8217;s creative director Quentin Cooper joined a panel of footie-loving celebrity scientists to debate how scientific improvements could make the beautiful game even more beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a talk called &#8220;Can Science Save Football?&#8221; at The Old Fire Station on March 31, the experts discussed corruption, injustice and big money in football, revealing how a scientific approach could make things better.</p>
<div class="advert-container tiny" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p><span id="more-1394"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Cooper, a veteran science journalist and Manchester City fan, was joined by Oxford University Professor for the Public Understanding of Science Marcus du Sautoy, Radio 4 science presenter Jim Al-Khalili, University of Reading zoologist Joanna Bagniewska and University of Cambridge statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The panel discussed putting microchips into players&#8217; kit to track who last touched the ball, using smart phones for better crowd safety, and generating data to inform fairness in the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Cooper, who lives in Princes Risborough, said: &#8220;Fans love to moan, but if we have a problem let’s think about how we can solve it: that’s what science does.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;So the question is: can we apply a bit of mind power to make the game fairer?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Cooper said the goal of science to make the world a better place could be just as productive on the football pitch as in a laboratory trying to cure cancer or send astronauts to Mars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He added: &#8220;There’s lots of football fans out there who feel like the game has fallen a bit into disarray.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Science is trying to make the world a better place and solve problems, so maybe a scientific approach can help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;The weird thing is that some people say they’re not interested in science, but whatever they are into there will be an element of science to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Whether it’s football, knitting, gardening or whatever, I defy you to come up with any subject that doesn’t have a scientific element.</p>
<div class="advert-container tiny" style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;People think they don’t like science, but secretly they do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Cooper insisted that many scientists like him shared a love of football and sports as well as their professional pursuits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He added: &#8220;That’s not the public perception of science, but we&#8217;re people too. We may be very logical about our research but we can still be potty about football.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to a game with Marcus du Sautoy &#8211; he’s not just sitting there thinking about numbers, he’s up and shouting in the stands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Lots of scientists are very passionate about the game.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>My post for the <a href="https://crastina.se/june_2015/">Crastina Column</a></em></p>
<p><strong>For many years Poland has experienced human capital flight, or “brain drain”. But this process is slowly becoming balanced by ”returnees”. The networking and communication skills of young members of the Polish scientific diaspora has played a crucial role. Joanna Bagniewska, zoologist and science disseminator, explains how.</strong><span id="more-1062"></span></p>
<p>Oxford University, crowds of scientists mingling during a poster session. Mathematicians get excited by animal migration, zoologists discuss nanotube properties with physicists, and biochemists talk about extrasolar planets. What brings researchers from these diverse fields together? What do they have in common? Surprisingly enough, it’s not their research topics or institutional affiliation – it’s their nationality. They all come from Poland, a country, which, like many others, is experiencing human capital flight, or “brain drain” – the migration of highly skilled, well-educated individuals in search of better opportunities.</p>
<p>Four years ago young Polish scientists from Oxford and Cambridge, aware of this problem, decided to start a conference strengthening the diaspora of Polish researchers, and their links with Poland.<em> <a href="https://www.polishperspectives.org/">Science: Polish Perspectives</a> </em>(or SPP for short) showcases top quality research, connects young Polish scientists working abroad, and discusses Poland’s future in science and technology. Each autumn 200 or so Polish scientists from all over Europe, most of them PhD students and postdocs, gather at either Oxford or Cambridge to listen to TED-style talks from a range of scientific disciplines. Apart from budding scientists there are also keynote speakers of notable grandeur, such as CERN’s President, Prof. Zalewska, or the leader of graphene growth research, Prof. Baranowski. The national focus gives the participants a sense of unity, although non-Poles are always welcome to attend as the event is held in English. In just four years SPP became not just a conference, but a community – of young, dynamic, outgoing researchers, passionate about their work and their roots.</p>
<p>The SPP format was picked up by Prof. Janusz Bujnicki of <a href="https://www.iimcb.gov.pl/">IIMCB</a>, a guest at SPP2014. He liked the idea so much, that he became the driving force behind <a href="https://www.polishscientificnetworks.pl/">Polish Scientific Networks</a>, SPP’s sister conference. This event, which will take place in Warsaw mid-June, aims to encourage Polish scientists working abroad to establish research groups in Poland, and to develop and foster collaborations between Poles from abroad and from the homeland. This is what Bujnicki calls “turning brain drain into brain circulation”.</p>
<p>Even though Poland has been slow to recognise the potential of its scientific diaspora, it recently unveiled several attractive grant programmes for “returnees” and foreigners, in the hope of drawing in excelling applicants and boosting the quality of Polish research. The SPP community, a centralised hub for Polish researchers abroad, can pinpoint their needs, while at the same time advertising the opportunities in the labs at home. Some Poles already chose to return – and while the differences in academic cultures don’t always make returns easy, these researchers will pave their way for others and form a support network. They will also draw on their previous connections to open Polish academia to more international projects. Hopefully soon we will witness a move from the source-sink model to a more bi-directional, horizontal exchange of ideas.</p>

<p>WILDLIFE conservation lecturer Dr Joanna Bagniewska has won a top award in the international final of a science communication competition.</p>
<p><span id="more-749"></span>Joanna, of Nottingham Trent University, won the International Alumni Award at the FameLab 2014 International Final for her talk on &#8216;bomber bees&#8217;, which explored how honeybees can be used to detect explosives and drugs.</p>
<p>FameLab International challenges researchers to present a topic to a non-specialist audience in just three minutes and is judged on content, clarity and charisma. The prize won by Joanna was voted for by FameLab alumni from previous years.</p>
<p>Joanna reached the international rounds after winning the national final in her native Poland.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;I feel very proud of this award and am extremely pleased to have got as far as I did. The standard of the competitors was very high, so I did not expect to win an award, especially not such a prestigious one.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Article from Jacobs University.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jacobs.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-309" src="https://jbagniewska.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/jacobs.png?w=500" alt="Jacobs" width="500" height="306" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Can animals change the way we think? Can we learn anything from invasive species? How do we measure animal behavior in the wild? Jacobs alumna Dr. Joanna Bagniewska (Class of 2006) ventured to answer these questions at the recent TEDxWarsaw in March.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna’s talk entitled <strong>“Learning the ways of the animals” </strong>was given at the independently organized TED event in Warsaw on March 21. She spoke about invasive species: plants and animals brought outside of their native range that have had huge environmental, agricultural, and financial impacts on their new surroundings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-306"></span>Although the war against biological invasives is costly (in Europe estimated at €12 billion per year), Joanna pointed out a silver lining. Like any powerful enemy, the adaptable and resilient invasive species challenge us to change our thinking; they push us to develop new methods of “espionage”. She said: “To match our invaders’ versatility, we need to come up with novel technologies and new analytical techniques for measuring their behavior in the wild.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna’s work on the invasive American mink in Europe helped her develop methodologies (based on miniaturized logging devices) that can be applied to a diversity of semi-aquatic animals. Such methods are not only crucial for learning more about minks themselves. They are important because animals dependent on or adapted to living in water can be found across most groups of mammals – and while some are invasive and may cause a serious threat to biodiversity, others are endangered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, before any eradication or conservation action is undertaken, there is a pressing need to find out as much as possible about the behavior and ecology of a particular species, she told the audience. In turn methods developed for an invasive could also be applied in order to save an endangered animal. Despite invasives often posing a danger to local species they can definitely contribute a lot to our knowledge and understanding of different branches of science.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna graduated from Jacobs University with a <a href="https://www.jacobs-university.de/undergraduate-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BSc in Biology</a>; she later finished her MSc and DPhil at <a href="https://www.wildcru.org/">Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit</a>. Her doctoral thesis focused on using novel biotelemetric methods to investigate the behavioral patterns of free-living semi-aquatic animals. Her research interests include wildlife conservation, behavioral ecology, and the use of technological solutions in biology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design)</strong> is a global set of conferences formed to disseminate &#8220;ideas worth spreading.&#8221;<br />

<div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WildCRU&#8217;s DPhil student, Joanna Bagniewska, was awarded the Acorn Ecology Best Student Presentation Prize at the recent Mammal Society Conference. There were a number of great talks at the event but Joanna&#8217;s presentation on the diving patterns of semi-aquatic, shallow-diving, small-bodied mammals was unanimously chosen as the winner.  The head of the voting committee, Sue Searle from Acorn Ecology, said that Joanna&#8217;s presentation was not only informative and engaging, but also had the extra &#8220;spark&#8221; that the jury was looking for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joanna was presenting WildCRU&#8217;s research on American mink using miniaturised Time-Depth Recorders (TDRs), tiny devices which measure temperature and pressure over time.  Using TDRs allows a precise determination of the diving behaviour of mink, as well as the examination of their activity patterns.  The methods explored by Joanna and her colleagues can also be used in measuring the activity of other semi-aquatic mammals.</p>
